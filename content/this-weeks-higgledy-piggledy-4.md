* [A Note to Readers](https://theintercept.com/2016/02/02/a-note-to-readers/) -- The Intercept publicly apologises and fixes its mistakes. At first sight this looks like it discredits the outlet, but after reading [David Simon on the State of Journalism](http://www.vulture.com/2015/11/david-simon-spotlight-the-wire-tom-mccarthy.html) I'd sure like to see this kind of public confession a lot more. The truth is it probably happens everywhere and we never know it; so The Intercept really is setting a very good example here.
* [Paul Graham is still asking to be eaten](https://medium.com/@girlziplocked/paul-graham-is-still-asking-to-be-eaten-5f021c0c0650) -- a nice bad essay on Silicon Valley's hegemonous thought (though a bit raging at moments)

Random thoughts
---------------

There are a zillion fun things to do in life. But one has to separate between what you like doing (what you find fun), and what you want to achieve. Because most fun things, no matter how fun they are, if you imagine yourself doing them, don't seem to bring much sense of fulfilment.
