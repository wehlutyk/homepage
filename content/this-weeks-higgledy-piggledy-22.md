Links, bits, bobs
-----------------

* [Nature, culture, ordure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-hW53S_G8) -- awesome conference by Philippe Descola at the Mucem!
* [Under2 Coalition](http://under2mou.org/) and [C40 Cities](http://www.c40.org/) -- governments are not the only transnational institutional level of action
* [Fuck Facebook](https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/fuck_facebook) -- "The Internet Archive is our only good defense against broken links. Blocking them from indexing Facebook content is a huge “fuck you” to anyone who cares about the longevity of the stuff they link to." It's also a really good way to push people to have a short memory, i.e. control over what parts of online history you see. Kind of spooky.
* [Important Harvard Scientists Attack Kin Selection: Context](https://jonfwilkins.blogspot.fr/2011/04/important-harvard-scientists-attack-kin.html) -- a nice intro to an emotionally charged sequence of events in evolutionary biology research
* [How The Intercept Outed Reality Winner](http://blog.erratasec.com/2017/06/how-intercept-outed-reality-winner.html) -- Color Laser printers add tracking near-invisible dots to your pages; this has been around for a decade, and the EFF [documents](https://www.eff.org/pages/list-printers-which-do-or-do-not-display-tracking-dots) what is known, but it's the first time I'm hearing about it!

* [La Ville ã Vélo](https://lavilleavelo.org/) -- actions vélo à Lyon
* [Revue S!lence](http://www.revuesilence.net/) -- un autre membre des [Médias Libres](http://medias-libres.org/)!
* [La Légumerie](http://www.lalegumerie.org/) -- "L'agriculture urbaine comme outil de production nourricière et de développement social & écologique sur le territoire de la Métropole de Lyon"; intéressant.

* [Corrupt, dangerous and brutal to its poor – but is Marseille the future of France?](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/08/corrupt-dangerous-brutal-poor-marseille-future-france) -- a very accurate article on Marseille, its life, politics, and the meaning of all this in the French context
