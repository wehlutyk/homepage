Links, bits, bobs

Not much this week, just a few thoughts on the scientific publication system (thanks Judicaël!): [La controverse en matière de publication des articles scientifiques](http://www.echosciences-grenoble.fr/articles/la-controverse-en-matiere-de-publication-des-articles-scientifiques).


Random thoughts
---------------

This section could turn into a list of questions I've been thinking about in the week. It's really more of a pensieve for myself, than something written for a specific audience. If you're interested, read on!

I've been looking at Australia a little these days, and looking at photos from Sydney makes one notice how similar it looks to North American coastal cities like San Francisco or even Vancouver. I wonder what exactly in the history of those cities makes them so different from European coastal cities (and esp. French ones). The fact that they started a lot later and have a different policy for conserving architecture? The different traditions in garden and park design?
