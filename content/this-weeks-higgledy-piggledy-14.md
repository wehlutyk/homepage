Links, bits, bobs
-----------------

* [POC21](http://www.poc21.cc/) -- an innovation camp for open source sustainability that started in the summer of 2015. Watch the [documentary](https://vimeo.com/148839195) and talk about it!
* [Open It Agency](http://openitagency.eu/) -- helping communities and businesses go open source
* [Enspiral](http://enspiral.com/about-enspiral/faq/) -- an intriguing organisation supporting people who want to work on something aligned with their values. Several members were at the POC21 camp.
* [Keep the idealism for yourself! Let's make cash and crash malign industries](https://medium.com/open-state/keep-the-idealism-for-yourself-let-s-make-cash-and-crash-malign-industries-4b1b384e29a0) -- interesting view bringing back part of the question of power and political (or in this case economical) struggle into the shiny candy "social entrepreneur" world.
* [CNESCO](http://www.cnesco.fr/) -- le Conseil National d'Évaluation du Système Scolaire (what a bureaucratic name) looks really interesting! They recently published a report on how the French school system generates inequalities. [Details here](http://www.cnesco.fr/inegalites-sociales-et-migratoires-comment-lecole-les-amplifie/). The nice part is that several newspapers really publicised the information, so it might stir some public (or private) debates.
* [Entretien avec Monchoachi : la parole sauvage à l'assaut de l'occident](https://lundi.am/Entretien-avec-Monchoachi-la-parole-sauvage-a-l-assaut-de-l-occident) -- «Non, je ne fais pas l'éloge de la démocratie, l'une des dernières vessies à laquelle s'accrochent les saltimbanques de ce monde en perdition.» Follow-up: [Élie Domota](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Domota).
* [Edgar Morin, l'urgence et l'essentiel](https://la-bas.org/la-bas-magazine/entretiens/edgar-morin-l-urgence-et-l-essentiel) sur *Là-bas si j'y suis*. Ce qui m'a amené à découvrir [Nocturnes productions](https://nocturnesproductions.net/), qui ont produit un documentaire sur Edgar Morin.


Random thoughts
---------------

*Ungamifying work*. There's a case for *not* gamifying work. The now popular saying "do something you like and you'll never have a day of work" is a bit treacherous I feel, as it blurs the lines between work and leisure. Which is the whole point, but the danger is that work is near-unavoidably linked to some flavour of optimisation (unless you're working against capitalism), and that mindset ends up leaking into your leisure and your whole life in fact.

*Best move*. I'm coming to the end of my PhD in a few months, and have been wondering for months now what to do next. The main project I'm interested in is evolving the scientific publication ecosystem (which is badly needed). I find the problem absolutely fascinating and super complex (make research sexy again!), but watching Patch Adams, Edgar Morin, and reading a few other more social and critical things (esp. about today's western civilisation) make me wonder: what do I really want to invest my time and energy in? What will I deem will have been the best move, once I'm 95 years old (if I get there)?

*Control*. One certainty is that, as Edgar Morin says, whatever I do, I won't control its outcome or how it gets woven into society. Which kind of makes you wonder what is worth (or meaningful) aiming or fighting for. Another reason why it's really important to fall in love with problems and not solutions.
