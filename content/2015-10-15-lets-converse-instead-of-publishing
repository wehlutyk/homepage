Summary: FILLME

Idea: the publishing system models a positivist science. Science isn't positivist, as you can see with quotes like this:

Brenda Maddox, Patron of the John Maddox Prize: “My late husband John had an unusual combination of knowledge of science and eloquence of expression. Someone once asked him, ‘how much of what you print is wrong?’ referring to Nature. John answered immediately, ‘all of it. That's what science is about – new knowledge constantly arriving to correct the old.’ He led a supreme example of science journalism and others will do well to look to it.”

Science is about controversy, and publishing does not accomodate that: a publication should be an objective 'data point', but there are many implicits built in a study, and a publication is used as a means for conversation and debate.

We need tools for controversy and debate.
