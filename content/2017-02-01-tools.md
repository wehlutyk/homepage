Summary: If you use your computer daily, tooling up can change your life.

Tools? Why dear god, why?
-------------------------

As an avid fan of the enactive approach to cognitive science, I deeply agree with Gregory Bateson's idea that the blind person's stick is part of their body and general sensorimotor apparatus (I'm not alone in this).

The same goes for one's everyday work tool, and in my case that's the personal computer.
One can go a long way with that principle, and prime examples are Bret Victor's talks [The Humane Representation of Thought](https://vimeo.com/115154289) and [Seeing Spaces](https://vimeo.com/97903574), setting out wonderful visions of how computerised tools could (will?) empower us in thought and creativity, turning e.g. the reflexive craft of programming into dynamic performance (also watch [The Future of Programming](https://vimeo.com/71278954) if you're into this).

There's also more modest achievements in modelling one's everyday interactions, of course. One of those, I think, is proper everyday tooling.
So since I have wondered many times about ways to transform my everyday thinking, with various attempts at practices to grow the fleeting ideas and wonderful imaginative feelings one can have throughout the course of a day;
since I have been asking myself what stuff people develop to cope with the ephemerality of thought, here is my current list of tools and tricks.

Hopefully I can come across something similar in the future published by other people, or even spark some conversation! (In some slightly more developed form than a `dotfiles` repository.)


The list
--------

Now, rather bluntly:

### Desktop

[ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/), with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as window manager, and Gnome Terminal with [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).

### Apps/programs

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for file editing, Firefox with the [Tab Tree](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-tree/) and [VimFx](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimfx/) extensions (and Zotero and other standard stuff) for browsing, [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) for blogging.

### Work

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) with Python's [scientific ecosystem](https://scipy.org/), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and git. Occasionally [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Hopefully a lot more of, soon, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Tracking

[Gnote](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gnote) for permanent notes and scratchpads, [RedNotebook](http://rednotebook.sourceforge.net/) for all dated notes, and [Hamster](http://projecthamster.org/) to track time spent on tasks and keep a good overview of work hours.

### Interface and incentives

The Dvorak keyboard layout. [Workrave](http://www.workrave.org/) to push me to take regular breaks so I don't go blind because of too much screen, and [RedShift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) so that said screen stays comfortable at all hours of the day and night.

There should be an up-to-date version of this list in the [Tools](/tools/) page from now on!
