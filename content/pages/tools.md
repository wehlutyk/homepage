Read [this post](/posts/2017-02-01-tools-of-the-trade/) for a quick discussion.


The current tools
-----------------

### Desktop

[ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/), the [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) compositor, and the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).

### Apps/programs

[Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/) for file editing, Firefox with the [Tab Center](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tab-center) and [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/) extensions (and Zotero and other standard stuff) for browsing.
Emacs with [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) for emails, [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) for blogging.

### Work

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) with Python's and Julia's [scientific](https://scipy.org/) [ecosystems](https://julialang.org/ecosystems/), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and git. Hopefully a lot more of, soon, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

### Tracking

[Orgmode](https://orgmode.org/) with [org-protocol](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html) to capture permanent and dated notes, and [Hamster](http://projecthamster.org/) to track time spent on tasks and keep a good overview of work hours.

### Interface and incentives

The Dvorak keyboard layout. A family to push me to take regular breaks so I don't go blind because of too much screen, and [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) so that said screen stays comfortable at all hours of the day and night.
