Summary: FILLME

Once you start thinking famous is good, you're going down a steep slope. You look up to famous people. And anything you read comes from someone who in some way is famous (you're reading them). So your critical reading goes away. You want to be one of them, and if you wonder whether that's good or not, the things you read are from famous people, so even if they criticize it's from within the system. There's two ways out: become famous(-ish), or start having critical thought once again. Rely on what you know and start thinking for yourself, not blindly trusting anything famous.
